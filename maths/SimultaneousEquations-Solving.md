# **Creating and Solving Simultaneous Equations**

Simultaneous equations are two (or more) equations that must be true **at the same time**.
We use them to find the values of two unknowns — usually **x** and **y**.

This topic covers:

* How to **create** simultaneous equations from real-life problems
* How to **solve** them using substitution and elimination
* Step-by-step examples
* Practice questions with answers

---

## ⭐ **What Are Simultaneous Equations?**

Example:

```
x + y = 10  
2x – y = 4
```

We must find the values of **x** and **y** that satisfy *both* equations.

# **PART 1 — Creating Simultaneous Equations (Word Problems)**

To create simultaneous equations, we look for:

* Two unknowns
* Two facts (clues) that involve the unknowns

### ✔ Common Situations

| Scenario         | Unknowns                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Comparing prices | cost of item A, cost of item B |
| Ages             | Person A’s age, Person B’s age |
| Speed & distance | speed of car A, speed of car B |
| Shapes           | side lengths, perimeter parts  |

## **Example 1 — Prices of Pens and Pencils**

*James buys 3 pens and 2 pencils for £4.20.
Maria buys 5 pens and 1 pencil for £5.10.*
Find the cost of one pen (**p**) and one pencil (**c**).

### Step 1 — Define variables

Let

```
p = cost of a pen  
c = cost of a pencil
```

### Step 2 — Translate sentences into equations

James:

```
3p + 2c = 4.20
```

Maria:

```
5p + 1c = 5.10
```

These two equations form a simultaneous system.

---

## **Example 2 — Ages**

*The sum of Asha's and Liam’s ages is 28.
Asha is 4 years older than Liam.*

Let:

```
a = Asha’s age  
l = Liam’s age
```

Equations:

```
a + l = 28  
a = l + 4
```

---

## **Example 3 — Perimeter of Two Shapes**

*A rectangle has length L and width W.
Its perimeter is 30 cm.
The length is 3 cm more than twice the width.*

Let:

```
L = length  
W = width
```

Equations:

```
2L + 2W = 30  
L = 2W + 3
```

---

# **PART 2 — Solving Simultaneous Equations**

There are two main methods you should know:

---

## ✔ Method 1 — Substitution

Use this when one equation is already written as:

```
x = ...
y = ...
```

### Example

```
a + l = 28  
a = l + 4
```

Step 1 — Substitute **a = l + 4** into the first equation:

```
(l + 4) + l = 28  
2l + 4 = 28  
2l = 24  
l = 12
```

Step 2 — Find a:

```
a = l + 4  
a = 16
```

✔ Ages:

```
Asha = 16  
Liam = 12
```

---

## ✔ Method 2 — Elimination

Use this when equations look like:

```
ax + by = ...  
cx + dy = ...
```

You make coefficients match, then subtract or add.

### Example

```
3p + 2c = 4.20  
5p + 1c = 5.10
```

Step 1 — Match c (multiply second equation by 2):

```
3p + 2c = 4.20  
(×2) → 10p + 2c = 10.20
```

Step 2 — Eliminate c:

```
10p – 3p = 7p  
10.20 – 4.20 = 6.00
```

So:

```
p = 6.00 ÷ 7  
p = £0.86
```

Step 3 — Substitute to find c:

```
5p + c = 5.10  
5(0.86) + c = 5.10  
4.30 + c = 5.10  
c = £0.80
```

✔ Final answer:

```
Pen = £0.86  
Pencil = £0.80
```

# **PART 3 — Mixed Example (Create + Solve)**

## **Example — School Trip Tickets**

*Adult tickets cost A pounds, child tickets cost C pounds.
A family buys 2 adult tickets and 3 child tickets for £37.
Another family buys 1 adult ticket and 4 child tickets for £29.*

Find A and C.

Let:

```
A = adult ticket price  
C = child ticket price
```

Equations:

```
1) 2A + 3C = 37  
2)  A + 4C = 29
```

Solve by elimination:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 (after doubling eq 2):

```
(2A + 3C = 37)  
(×2 → 2A + 8C = 58)
```

Now subtract:

```
(2A + 8C) – (2A + 3C) = 58 – 37  
5C = 21  
C = 4.20
```

Use equation 2:

```
A + 4(4.20) = 29  
A + 16.80 = 29  
A = 12.20
```

✔ **Adult ticket = £12.20
Child ticket = £4.20**
