# **Simultaneous Equations – Full Guide**

## **What are simultaneous equations?**

Simultaneous equations are two or more equations that involve the same variables.
Your goal is to find values of the variables that satisfy *all* equations at the same time.

---

## **Example**

Solve:

```
2x + y = 7
x - y = 1
```

### **Method 1: Substitution**

From the second equation:

```
x = y + 1
```

Substitute into the first:

```
2(y + 1) + y = 7
3y + 2 = 7
3y = 5
y = 5/3
```

Then:

```
x = y + 1 = 8/3
```

### **Method 2: Elimination**

Add both equations:

```
2x + y + x - y = 7 + 1
3x = 8
x = 8/3
```

Substitute back to find `y`:

```
x - y = 1 → 8/3 - y = 1 → y = 5/3
```
