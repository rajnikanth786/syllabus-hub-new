# **Solving Simultaneous Equations with No Common Coefficients**

When solving simultaneous equations, things are easy when one variable already has the same coefficient in both equations (like both have **2x** or **3y**).
But what if the equations look like this?

```
3x + 4y = 22
5x – 2y = 8
```

Here, **x** has coefficients **3 and 5**, and **y** has **4 and –2** — nothing matches.

This lesson shows you how to solve such problems using the **Elimination Method** by **creating common coefficients yourself**.

---

## ⭐ **Key Idea**

If the coefficients don’t match, we **multiply** one or both equations until *either* the **x** coefficients or the **y** coefficients match (or become exact opposites).

Once they match, we eliminate a variable normally.

# **Method 1: Make the x-coefficients match**

### Example 1

Solve:

```
3x + 4y = 22
5x – 2y = 8
```

### Step 1 — Make x coefficients the same

LCM of **3** and **5** is **15**.

Multiply the first equation by **5** and the second by **3**:

```
(×5) → 15x + 20y = 110
(×3) → 15x – 6y = 24
```

### Step 2 — Eliminate x

Subtract the second from the first:

```
(15x + 20y) – (15x – 6y) = 110 – 24
20y + 6y = 86
26y = 86
y = 86 ÷ 26
y = 3.31 (rounded)
```

### Step 3 — Substitute to find x

Using the original second equation:

```
5x – 2y = 8
5x – 2(3.31) = 8
5x – 6.62 = 8
5x = 14.62
x = 2.924
```

✔ **Solution:**

```
x ≈ 2.92  
y ≈ 3.31
```

# **Method 2: Make the y-coefficients match**

Let’s solve the same system again, but using y this time.

### Step 1 — Make y coefficients the same

We have **4** and **–2**.
LCM is **4**.

Multiply the second equation by **2**:

```
3x + 4y = 22
(×2) → 10x – 4y = 16
```

### Step 2 — Add the equations

```
3x + 4y
10x – 4y
--------------
13x = 38
x = 38 ÷ 13
x = 3
```

### Step 3 — Substitute to find y

Use the original first equation:

```
3x + 4y = 22
3(3) + 4y = 22
9 + 4y = 22
4y = 13
y = 13 ÷ 4
y = 3.25
```

✔ **Solution:**

```
x = 3  
y = 3.25
```

This method gave a cleaner answer!

# **When Should I Match x or y?**

Choose whichever:

* Has smaller coefficients
* Gives fewer steps
* Avoids large multipliers

Example:

```
7x + 3y = 22
2x + 5y = 19
```

Better to match **x** (LCM = 14) than **y** (LCM = 15).
