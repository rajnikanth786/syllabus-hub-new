# 🧭 Year 8 Physics – Lesson 2: Forces and Their Effects

*(Oxford / AQA style notes for KS3 learners)*

---

## 🔹 1.1 What Is a Force?

A **force** is a **push, pull, twist or stretch** that one object exerts on another.
Whenever you **change how something moves or what shape it has**, a force is involved.

Forces can:

* Start or stop motion
* Speed things up or slow them down
* Change direction
* Change shape (stretch, squash, bend)

**Symbol:** ( F )  **Unit:** Newton (N)
**Instrument:** *Newton meter* or *spring balance*

---

### 🌍 Everyday examples

| Example                     | Type of Force | Effect        |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Pushing a door              | Contact       | Opens it      |
| Gravity pulling a ball down | Non-contact   | Ball falls    |
| Brakes on a bike            | Friction      | Slows motion  |
| Stretching a spring         | Tension       | Changes shape |

---

## 🔹 1.2 Contact and Non-Contact Forces

| **Contact Forces**      | **Non-Contact Forces** |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Friction                | Gravity                |
| Air resistance          | Magnetic force         |
| Tension in rope         | Electrostatic force    |
| Normal (reaction) force |                        |

**Contact:** objects must touch.
**Non-contact:** act across space—no direct contact.

---

## 🔹 1.3 Measuring Forces

* **Spring balance / Newton meter** measures how strongly a spring is stretched by a force.
* Always **zero** the scale before measuring.
* Read at **eye level** to avoid parallax errors.

---

## 🔹 1.4 Resultant Force – The “Overall” Force

When several forces act on an object, we combine them to find the **resultant force**.

* **Balanced forces:** all forces cancel → **no change** in motion.
* **Unbalanced forces:** not equal → object **accelerates, decelerates, or changes direction**.

**Example 1 – Balanced:**
Book on a table → weight (down) = reaction (up) ⇒ no motion.

**Example 2 – Unbalanced:**
Car engine pushes forward with 400 N, friction is 300 N.
→ Resultant = 400 − 300 = **100 N forward**
→ Car **accelerates** forward.

---

## 🔹 1.5 Newton’s First Law of Motion

> “An object will stay at rest or move at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.”

**Examples:**

* A hockey puck slides on ice (low friction) until friction and air resistance slow it.
* Seat belts keep passengers from moving forward when the car suddenly stops (inertia).

---

## 🔹 1.6 Mass and Weight

| Term           | Meaning                       | Unit           | Depends on       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Mass (m)**   | Amount of matter in an object | kilograms (kg) | Object itself    |
| **Weight (W)** | Force of gravity on that mass | newtons (N)    | Gravity strength |

[
\textbf{W = m × g}
]
Where ( g ) = 9.8 N/kg on Earth (≈ 10 N/kg for easy maths).

**Example:**
A 5 kg object → ( W = 5 × 9.8 = 49 N ).
On the Moon, ( g ≈ 1.6 N/kg ), so weight = ( 5 × 1.6 = 8 N ).

**Key idea:**
Mass stays the same everywhere; weight changes with gravity.

---

## 🔹 1.7 Gravity

* Gravity pulls all objects **toward the centre of Earth**.
* It gives objects **weight** and causes **free fall**.
* On Earth, all objects fall with the **same acceleration** (ignoring air resistance).

---

## 🔹 1.8 Friction and Air Resistance

### ⚙️ Friction

A **contact force** that acts **opposite** to motion when two surfaces touch.

**Effects:**

* Wears surfaces down and produces heat.
* Can be **useful** (grip, stopping vehicles) or **unhelpful** (wastes energy).

**Reduce friction:**
Use **lubricants (oil)**, **smooth surfaces**, or **ball bearings**.

---

### 🌬️ Air Resistance (Drag)

A type of **friction with air particles** acting opposite to movement.

* Depends on **speed**, **shape**, and **surface area**.
* Greater speed → greater air resistance.

**Streamlining**:
Designing shapes (cars, planes, fish) so air flows smoothly to **reduce drag**.

**Parachutes:**
Increase air resistance to slow descent.

## 🔹 1.9 Balanced and Unbalanced Forces in Action

| Situation         | Forces                  | Motion                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Book on desk      | Weight = Reaction       | Stationary                         |
| Skydiver at start | Weight > Air resistance | Accelerates down                   |
| Skydiver later    | Weight = Air resistance | Constant speed (terminal velocity) |
| Rocket launch     | Thrust > Weight + drag  | Accelerates upward                 |

## 🔹 1.10 Hooke’s Law – Stretching Springs

When a **spring** or elastic band is stretched:

* The **extension** increases with the applied **force**.
* As long as the spring is not overstretched,
  [
  \textbf{F = k × e}
  ]

| Symbol | Meaning         | Unit        |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| F      | Force           | Newtons (N) |
| k      | Spring constant | N/m         |
| e      | Extension       | metres (m)  |

**Experiment outline:**

1. Hang spring on clamp stand.
2. Add 1 N weights step by step.
3. Measure new length each time.
4. Plot Force vs Extension graph.

   * Straight line = obeys Hooke’s Law.
   * Beyond “limit of proportionality” = permanent deformation.

**Applications:** suspension systems, trampolines, weighing scales.

---

## 🔹 1.11 Free-Body Diagrams

Show **all forces** acting on an object using arrows:

* **Direction** → shows where the force acts.
* **Length** → shows size (magnitude).
* **Label** each arrow (weight, friction, thrust, upthrust, etc.).

**Example:**
A car moving at constant speed → forward thrust = backward drag → balanced.

---

## 🔹 1.12 Upthrust and Floating

* **Upthrust** is the **upward force** on objects in fluids (liquids or gases).
* Caused by **pressure differences** in the fluid.
* If upthrust = weight → object floats.
* If weight > upthrust → object sinks.

**Example:**
A ship floats because its average density (metal + air spaces) is less than water’s density.

---

## 🔹 1.13 Magnetic and Electrostatic Forces

* **Magnetic forces:** between **magnets** or **magnetic materials** (iron, steel, nickel, cobalt).

  * **Like poles repel**, **opposite poles attract**.
* **Electrostatic forces:** between **charged objects**.

  * **Like charges repel**, **opposites attract**.
  * Example: balloon sticking to wall after rubbing.

Both are **non-contact** forces.

---

## 🔹 1.14 Moments (Turning Effect) – Preview for Next Lesson

A **moment** is the turning effect of a force about a pivot.

[
\text{Moment} = \text{Force} × \text{Perpendicular distance from pivot}
]

Units: Newton-metres (N m)

You’ll study this in detail in *Lesson 2*.

## 🧠 Key Formulas to Remember

| Formula                                          | Meaning                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| ( W = m × g )                                    | Weight from mass and gravity |
| ( F = k × e )                                    | Hooke’s Law for springs      |
| Resultant Force = Total Forward – Total Backward | Net force direction          |
| Moment = Force × Distance                        | Turning effect (next lesson) |

## 📘 Worked Examples

**Example 1:**
A 15 kg suitcase on Earth → what is its weight?
[
W = 15 × 9.8 = 147 N
]

**Example 2:**
A car engine pushes 6000 N forward; air resistance + friction = 5000 N.
→ Resultant = **1000 N forward** → car accelerates.

**Example 3:**
A spring stretches 5 cm when pulled by 2.5 N.
Find ( k ):
[
k = F ÷ e = 2.5 ÷ 0.05 = 50 N/m
]
