# ⚖️ **Year 8 Physics – Lesson 4: Equilibrium and Resultant Force**

*(Oxford AQA Science – KS3 Forces & Motion Unit, detailed for revision and test preparation)*

---

## 🔹 4.1 What Is a Force? (Quick Recap)

A **force** is a **push or pull** that can:

* Make an object **move, stop, speed up, slow down**, or **change direction**
* Change the **shape** of an object

**Measured in:** Newtons (N)
**Instrument:** Spring balance / Newton meter

Common forces:

* Gravity (weight)
* Friction / air resistance
* Tension (in ropes/strings)
* Normal or reaction force (from a surface)
* Thrust (from engines or muscles)

---

## 🔹 4.2 What Is Equilibrium?

> **Equilibrium** means all the forces acting on an object are **balanced**, so there is **no change in motion**.

In equilibrium:

* The object stays **still**, or
* Moves at a **constant speed** in a **straight line**.

In other words:
[
\textbf{Resultant Force = 0 N}
]

---

### 🌍 Everyday Examples of Equilibrium

| Example                         | Forces acting                             | Explanation              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A book resting on a table       | Weight (down), Reaction (up)              | Forces equal → no motion |
| A car moving at constant speed  | Driving force = Friction + Air resistance | Balanced → steady motion |
| A skydiver at terminal velocity | Weight = Air resistance                   | Falls at constant speed  |
| A hanging lamp                  | Weight (down) = Tension (up)              | No movement              |

---

### ⚖️ Key Concept

If **forces are balanced**, there’s **no acceleration** — the object is in **equilibrium**.
If **forces are unbalanced**, the object’s **speed or direction** changes.

---

## 🔹 4.3 Resultant Force – The Overall Force

> The **resultant force** is the **single force** that has the **same effect** as all the forces acting together.

Think of it as **adding** or **subtracting** all forces to see what’s “left over.”

---

### 🧮 Formula (Simple cases in one direction)

[
\textbf{Resultant Force} = \text{Total Force in one direction} - \text{Total Force in opposite direction}
]

---

### ✅ Example 1 – Forces in Opposite Directions

A car engine provides 500 N forward, and air resistance + friction total 300 N backward.
[
\text{Resultant Force} = 500 - 300 = 200 N \text{ forward}
]

👉 The car **accelerates forward**.

---

### ✅ Example 2 – Balanced Forces

A book has a weight of 10 N and a normal reaction force of 10 N upward.
[
\text{Resultant Force} = 10 - 10 = 0 N
]
👉 The book stays still (in equilibrium).

---

### ✅ Example 3 – Hanging Object

A lamp is pulled by two wires:

* Wire A = 5 N upward
* Weight = 5 N downward
  [
  \text{Resultant Force} = 0 N
  ]
  👉 Lamp is in **equilibrium**.

---

## 🔹 4.4 Balanced vs Unbalanced Forces

| **Condition**  | **Resultant Force** | **Effect on Object**                               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Balanced**   | 0 N                 | Object stays still or moves at constant speed      |
| **Unbalanced** | Not 0 N             | Object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction |

---

### 🌍 Example Situations

| Scenario                        | Forces                     | Resultant     | Motion                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Car cruising at steady 60 km/h  | Driving = Resistance       | 0 N           | Constant speed                    |
| Car accelerating                | Driving > Resistance       | > 0 N forward | Speeds up                         |
| Skydiver before parachute opens | Weight > Air resistance    | > 0 N down    | Accelerates downward              |
| Parachute open                  | Weight = Air resistance    | 0 N           | Constant fall (terminal velocity) |
| Ball hitting wall               | Force from wall > momentum | Unbalanced    | Changes direction                 |

---

## 🔹 4.5 Forces Acting in More Than One Direction

Sometimes, forces act at **angles**, not just straight lines.

To find equilibrium:

* The **upward forces** must equal the **downward forces**.
* The **forward forces** must equal the **backward forces**.

**Example:**
A box on a slope has:

* Weight (downward)
* Reaction force (perpendicular to slope)
* Friction (up slope)

If these are balanced, the box stays still → in **equilibrium**.

---

## 🔹 4.6 Free-Body Diagrams (Force Diagrams)

**Purpose:** To show all forces acting on an object.

**Rules:**

* Represent the object as a dot or box.
* Draw arrows for each force.
* Arrow **length** = strength (magnitude).
* Arrow **direction** = direction of force.
* Label all arrows (e.g., weight, reaction, friction, thrust).

---

### ✏️ Example 1 – Stationary Box on a Table

```
     ↑  Reaction Force (10 N)
     ■
     ↓  Weight (10 N)
```

Forces equal and opposite → **equilibrium**.

---

### ✏️ Example 2 – Car Accelerating

```
→ Thrust (500 N)
← Friction + Air Resistance (300 N)
```

Resultant = 200 N → moves forward (unbalanced).

---

### ✏️ Example 3 – Skydiver

At first:

* Weight > Air resistance → accelerates down.
  Later:
* Weight = Air resistance → falls at constant speed.

---

## 🔹 4.7 Newton’s First Law of Motion

> “If the resultant force on an object is zero, it will stay at rest or keep moving at a constant speed in a straight line.”

This law explains **equilibrium**.

* **Resultant force = 0 N** → equilibrium.
* **Resultant force ≠ 0 N** → acceleration (speed or direction changes).

---

## 🔹 4.8 Newton’s Second Law (Extension for advanced Year 8)

When a resultant force acts on an object, it causes **acceleration**.

[
\textbf{F = m × a}
]

| Symbol | Quantity     | Unit |
| ------ | ------------ | ---- |
| F      | Force        | N    |
| m      | Mass         | kg   |
| a      | Acceleration | m/s² |

**More force → more acceleration.**
**More mass → less acceleration.**

Example:
If a 1,000 kg car has a resultant force of 2,000 N:
[
a = F ÷ m = 2000 ÷ 1000 = 2 \text{ m/s²}
]

---

## 🔹 4.9 Static Equilibrium (Objects Not Moving)

Objects are in **static equilibrium** when:

* They are **stationary**, and
* All **forces and moments** are balanced.

Examples:

* A ladder leaning safely against a wall
* A bridge supporting cars evenly
* A hanging lamp at rest

In static equilibrium:
[
\text{Sum of all forces} = 0
]
[
\text{Sum of all moments (turning effects)} = 0
]

---

## 🔹 4.10 Resultant Force in Two Dimensions (Simple Concept)

At KS3, you can reason qualitatively:

If forces act at **right angles** (e.g., up and sideways):

* The **resultant** lies **between them**.
* The bigger the stronger force, the closer the resultant is to its direction.

Example:
A kite is pulled upward by lift and sideways by wind.
The **resultant** shows the kite’s actual direction of motion.

## 🔹 4.11 Everyday Examples of Equilibrium and Resultant Force

| Example              | Forces                       | Result                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Hanging sign         | Tension = Weight             | Balanced (still)         |
| Bird gliding         | Lift = Weight, Thrust = Drag | Constant speed           |
| Tug-of-war           | Equal pulls                  | Rope stays still         |
| Unequal pulls        | One side stronger            | Rope moves that way      |
| Car at rest on slope | Friction + Reaction = Weight | Balanced                 |
| Friction removed     | Weight > Friction            | Slides down (unbalanced) |

## 🧮 Quick Calculations

**1.** Forces acting on object: 20 N left, 15 N right.
Resultant = ( 20 - 15 = 5 N ) left.
Object moves left.

**2.** Forces acting upward = 60 N, downward = 60 N.
Resultant = 0 N → object in equilibrium.

**3.** A car of 1000 kg experiences resultant 2000 N.
Acceleration = ( F ÷ m = 2000 ÷ 1000 = 2 , \text{m/s²} ).

---

## 🔬 Simple Classroom Experiment (For Understanding Equilibrium)

**Aim:** To show how forces can balance.

**You need:**

* A newton meter
* A spring
* A stand and a weight

**Method:**

1. Hang a 2 N weight from the spring.
2. Measure how much the spring stretches.
3. Add another 2 N weight → spring stretches twice as much.
4. Note that the **spring force upward** equals the **weight downward**.

✅ When balanced, the object doesn’t move — it’s in **equilibrium**.

---

## 🧾 Quick Recap Summary

* **Resultant force** = combined effect of all forces.
* **Equilibrium** = all forces balance → no change in motion.
* **Balanced forces** → constant speed or stationary.
* **Unbalanced forces** → acceleration or direction change.
* Represent forces with **free-body diagrams**.
* **Newton’s First Law** explains equilibrium.
* **Newton’s Second Law (F = m × a)** explains motion when unbalanced.
