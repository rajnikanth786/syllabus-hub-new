## 🔹 2.1 Introduction – What Are Mass and Weight?

These two words are often mixed up, but in science **they mean very different things**.

| Concept                    | **Mass**                                     | **Weight**                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it tells us**       | How much **matter** or “stuff” an object has | The **force of gravity** pulling on that matter                   |
| **Type of quantity**       | **Scalar** (has size only)                   | **Vector** (has size and direction – towards the centre of Earth) |
| **Symbol**                 | ( m )                                        | ( W )                                                             |
| **Measured in**            | kilograms (kg)                               | newtons (N)                                                       |
| **Measuring instrument**   | **Balance** or **mass scale**                | **Spring balance / Newton meter**                                 |
| **Changes with location?** | ❌ No – mass is constant everywhere           | ✅ Yes – depends on local gravity strength                         |
| **Formula**                | —                                            | ( W = m × g )                                                     |

## 🧠 Key Idea

> **Mass is what you have. Weight is how strongly gravity pulls on it.**

Imagine carrying a backpack:

* On Earth, gravity is strong → it **feels heavy**.
* On the Moon, gravity is weaker → **same backpack** but **feels lighter**.
* In space, with almost no gravity → backpack **floats** but **mass stays the same**!

---

## 🔹 2.2 Understanding Gravity

### What is gravity?

Gravity is a **non-contact force** that pulls all objects toward each other.
The **Earth’s gravity** pulls everything toward its centre.

**Gravitational field strength (g):**

* The **force of gravity per kilogram of mass**
* Measured in **newtons per kilogram (N/kg)**

| Location | g (N/kg)  | Comment          |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Earth    | 9.8 (≈10) | Strong pull      |
| Moon     | 1.6       | Weaker pull      |
| Mars     | 3.7       | Medium pull      |
| Jupiter  | 24.5      | Very strong pull |

---

### Why we have weight

When gravity acts on your mass, you feel **weight** — a downward **force**.

> 💡 *The more mass you have, the greater your weight.*

Example:
If you double your mass, your weight doubles too (on the same planet).

---

## 🔹 2.3 The Weight Formula

[
\textbf{Weight (W) = Mass (m) × Gravitational field strength (g)}
]

| Symbol | Quantity                     | Unit           |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| ( W )  | Weight                       | Newtons (N)    |
| ( m )  | Mass                         | Kilograms (kg) |
| ( g )  | Gravitational field strength | N/kg           |

### ⚙️ Examples

**1.** A 5 kg object on Earth:
[
W = 5 × 9.8 = 49 N
]

**2.** The same object on the Moon (( g = 1.6 )):
[
W = 5 × 1.6 = 8 N
]

So the object **weighs less** but **mass remains 5 kg**.

---

## 🔹 2.4 Measuring Mass and Weight

### Measuring **Mass**

* Use a **digital balance** or **beam balance**.
* Compares unknown mass to known ones.
* Works the same **anywhere in the universe**.

### Measuring **Weight**

* Use a **spring balance (Newton meter)**.
* The spring stretches more when a heavier object is hung from it.
* Works only where **gravity acts**.
* Shows force in **newtons (N)**.

## 🔹 2.5 Comparing Mass and Weight – Real-World Examples

| Object     | Mass (kg) | Weight on Earth (N) | Weight on Moon (N) |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Apple      | 0.1       | 1                   | 0.16               |
| School bag | 5         | 50                  | 8                  |
| Person     | 50        | 490                 | 80                 |
| Car        | 1000      | 9800                | 1600               |

**Notice:** As gravity decreases, weight decreases proportionally.

## 🔹 2.6 Mass, Weight, and the Space Environment

* In **space**, astronauts are said to be **weightless** because they are in **free fall** around Earth.
* They **still have mass**, so they resist changes in motion (inertia).
* Even in orbit, gravity is still acting — it just causes continuous falling around Earth.

## 🔹 2.7 Free-Body Diagrams for Weight

To visualise weight, draw **force arrows**.

| Situation                        | Diagram                                    | Explanation                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Book on table                    | ↓ Weight (gravity), ↑ Reaction             | Balanced forces – no motion |
| Falling object                   | ↓ Weight (gravity), ↑ Small air resistance | Accelerates down            |
| Parachutist at terminal velocity | ↓ Weight = ↑ Air resistance                | Constant speed              |

## 🔹 2.8 Weight and Mass in Everyday Life

### ⚖️ In lifts (elevators)

When a lift accelerates upward, you feel **heavier** (more normal force).
When it accelerates downward, you feel **lighter**.
Your **mass** never changes, only the **forces acting on you**.

### 🚀 On planets

Space agencies must calculate the **weight** of landers on other planets to design **safe landings** and **thrusters**.

### ⚽ In sports

* Weight affects **how fast** objects fall and **how much force** they hit with.
* Footballs feel lighter on the Moon because gravity is weaker!

## 🔹 2.9 Weight vs Mass – Key Misconceptions

| Misconception                            | Correct Idea                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Weight is measured in kg.”              | ❌ Weight is a **force**, measured in **newtons (N)**.          |
| “Mass changes when you go to the Moon.”  | ❌ Mass is constant everywhere.                                 |
| “Gravity and weight are the same thing.” | ❌ Gravity is the **field**, weight is the **force** due to it. |

## 🔹 2.10 Practise Using the Formula

### ✏️ Worked Example 1

A stone has a mass of 3 kg. Calculate its weight on Earth.
[
W = m × g = 3 × 9.8 = 29.4 N
]

### ✏️ Worked Example 2

An astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth. What will they weigh on the Moon (( g = 1.6 ))?

Step 1 – Find mass:
[
m = W ÷ g = 800 ÷ 9.8 ≈ 81.6 \text{ kg}
]

Step 2 – Weight on Moon:
[
W = 81.6 × 1.6 ≈ 130.6 N
]

➡️ *So they weigh about 131 N on the Moon.*

### ✏️ Worked Example 3

Find the mass of an object that weighs 245 N on Earth.
[
m = W ÷ g = 245 ÷ 9.8 = 25 \text{ kg}
]

## 🔹 2.11 Gravity and Weight Graph

If you plot **Weight (N)** on the y-axis and **Mass (kg)** on the x-axis:

* It’s a **straight line** through the origin.
* The **gradient = gravitational field strength (g)**.

  * On Earth, slope ≈ 9.8 N/kg.
  * On Moon, slope ≈ 1.6 N/kg.

**Meaning:**
Weight is **directly proportional** to mass.

---

## 🔹 2.12 The Role of Weight in Free Fall

When an object falls:

* Weight pulls it downward.
* Air resistance pushes upward.
* As it falls faster, air resistance increases until it balances weight → **terminal velocity**.
* Then it falls at a **steady speed**.

This connects to both **forces** and **mass–weight** concepts.

## 🧭 Summary — What You Must Remember

* **Mass** is the **amount of matter**, measured in **kg**.
* **Weight** is the **force due to gravity**, measured in **N**.
* Relationship: ( W = m × g ).
* On different planets, ( g ) changes, so **weight changes**.
* Graph of **Weight vs Mass** → straight line through origin; gradient = ( g ).
* **Gravity** gives us **weight**, keeps our **feet on the ground**, and causes **objects to fall**.
