# 🏎️ **Year 8 Physics – Lessons 6 & 7: Speed and Motion**

---

## 🔹 6.1 What Is Speed?

> **Speed** tells us how quickly an object moves — how much **distance** it covers in a certain **time**.

[
\textbf{Speed (v) = Distance (d) ÷ Time (t)}
]

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit                    | Formula              |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| ( v )  | Speed    | metres per second (m/s) | ( v = \dfrac{d}{t} ) |
| ( d )  | Distance | metres (m)              | ( d = v × t )        |
| ( t )  | Time     | seconds (s)             | ( t = \dfrac{d}{v} ) |

---

### ⚙️ Example Meaning

* **Fast object:** large distance in short time
* **Slow object:** small distance in same time

**Example:**
A car travels 100 metres in 5 seconds.
[
v = \dfrac{100}{5} = 20 , \text{m/s}
]
So the car’s speed is **20 metres per second**.

---

## 🔹 6.2 Units of Speed

| Unit | Meaning             | Used for             |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| m/s  | metres per second   | Science calculations |
| km/h | kilometres per hour | Cars, journeys       |
| mph  | miles per hour      | UK road speed limits |

**Conversion:**
[
1 , \text{m/s} = 3.6 , \text{km/h}
]

---

### 💡 Conversion Example

If a runner’s speed is 5 m/s:
[
5 × 3.6 = 18 , \text{km/h}
]
So the runner moves at 18 km/h.

---

## 🔹 6.3 Average Speed vs Instantaneous Speed

| Type                    | Description                 | Example                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Average speed**       | Total distance ÷ total time | 200 km in 4 hours → 50 km/h         |
| **Instantaneous speed** | Speed at a specific moment  | Car speedometer shows current speed |

**Example:**
Your car’s average speed on a trip might be 60 km/h,
but the **instantaneous** speed changes all the time —
e.g., 30 km/h in traffic, 80 km/h on highway.

---

## 🔹 6.4 Measuring Speed (Lab and Real Life)

### **Method 1 – Using a stopwatch**

1. Measure a known **distance** (e.g., 10 m track).
2. Time how long it takes to move between two points.
3. Use ( v = d ÷ t ).

### **Method 2 – Using light gates (in lab)**

* A light beam breaks when an object passes through.
* The computer or timer records the time automatically.
* Allows more accurate speed measurement.

---

## 🔹 6.5 Distance–Time Graphs

### 🧩 What They Show:

A **distance-time graph** shows **how far** an object travels **over time**.

* **Time** on x-axis
* **Distance** on y-axis
* **Slope (gradient)** = **speed**

---

### 🧠 Key Graph Interpretations

| Graph Shape                   | Meaning            | Description                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Straight line (upward)        | **Constant speed** | Object moving at steady pace |
| Horizontal line               | **Stationary**     | Object not moving            |
| Steeper line                  | **Faster speed**   | Greater gradient = faster    |
| Curved line (getting steeper) | **Accelerating**   | Speed increasing             |
| Curved line (flattening)      | **Decelerating**   | Speed decreasing             |
| Downward slope                | **Returning**      | Moving back toward start     |

---

### ✏️ Example:

A car travels 100 m in 10 s, then stops for 5 s.

* From 0–10 s: straight upward line (steady motion)
* From 10–15 s: horizontal line (no movement)

---

## 🔹 6.6 Calculating Speed from a Graph

The **gradient (slope)** of a distance–time graph gives the **speed**.

[
\text{Speed} = \dfrac{\text{Change in Distance}}{\text{Change in Time}}
]

**Example:**
If distance increases from 0 to 50 m in 5 s:
[
v = \dfrac{50}{5} = 10 , \text{m/s}
]

---

## 🔹 6.7 Interpreting Motion Graphs – Practice Examples

| Section | Description                  | Speed (m/s)    |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| 0–5 s   | Distance increases 0 → 25 m  | ( 25 ÷ 5 = 5 ) |
| 5–10 s  | Distance constant (flat)     | ( 0 ÷ 5 = 0 )  |
| 10–15 s | Distance increases 25 → 50 m | ( 25 ÷ 5 = 5 ) |

✅ The object moved, stopped, then moved again.

---

## 🔹 6.8 Speed and Energy

Faster-moving objects have more **kinetic energy**.
Kinetic energy depends on both **mass** and **speed**.

[
E_k = \dfrac{1}{2} m v^2
]
*(You’ll explore this in GCSE.)*

Example:
A car moving twice as fast has **four times** the kinetic energy.

---

## 🔹 6.9 Relative Speed (Extension)

When two objects move **towards** each other:
[
v_\text{relative} = v_1 + v_2
]

When moving **in the same direction**:
[
v_\text{relative} = |v_1 - v_2|
]

Example:

* Car A = 20 m/s, Car B = 30 m/s (same direction) → Relative = 10 m/s
* Opposite directions → 50 m/s

---

## 🔹 7.0 Acceleration (Introducing Motion Changes)

When speed changes, the object is **accelerating** or **decelerating**.

[
\textbf{Acceleration (a) = } \dfrac{\text{Change in Speed}}{\text{Time taken}}
]

| Symbol | Quantity      | Unit |
| ------ | ------------- | ---- |
| ( a )  | Acceleration  | m/s² |
| ( v )  | Final speed   | m/s  |
| ( u )  | Initial speed | m/s  |
| ( t )  | Time          | s    |

[
a = \dfrac{v - u}{t}
]

---

### ✏️ Example:

A car speeds up from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 s.
[
a = \dfrac{30 - 10}{5} = 4 , \text{m/s²}
]

**Meaning:**
The car’s speed increases by 4 m/s every second.

---

### ⚙️ Negative Acceleration

If speed decreases, acceleration is **negative** (deceleration).

Example:
A bike slows from 12 m/s to 4 m/s in 2 s.
[
a = \dfrac{4 - 12}{2} = -4 , \text{m/s²}
]
✅ The bike is **decelerating** at 4 m/s².

---

## 🔹 7.1 Speed–Time Graphs

A **speed-time graph** shows how speed changes over time.

| Graph Shape           | Meaning                | Interpretation   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Horizontal line       | Constant speed         | No acceleration  |
| Upward sloping line   | Acceleration           | Speed increasing |
| Downward sloping line | Deceleration           | Speed decreasing |
| Area under graph      | **Distance travelled** |                  |

---

### 💡 Example – Car accelerating

If a car accelerates steadily from 0 to 20 m/s in 5 s:
[
a = \dfrac{20 - 0}{5} = 4 , \text{m/s²}
]
Distance = area of triangle under graph =
[
\dfrac{1}{2} × 5 × 20 = 50 , \text{m}
]

---

## 🔹 7.2 Factors Affecting Speed

| Factor                        | Explanation                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Force applied**             | More force → greater acceleration    |
| **Mass of object**            | Heavier object → slower acceleration |
| **Friction / air resistance** | Reduces speed                        |
| **Surface / slope**           | Downhill → faster; uphill → slower   |
| **Energy available**          | More energy = higher maximum speed   |

---

## 🔹 7.3 Speed in Real Life

| Object          | Typical Speed           |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Walking human   | 1.4 m/s (5 km/h)        |
| Running         | 3–5 m/s (11–18 km/h)    |
| Bicycle         | 6–10 m/s (20–36 km/h)   |
| Car             | 20–30 m/s (72–108 km/h) |
| Passenger plane | 250 m/s                 |
| Speed of sound  | 340 m/s                 |
| Speed of light  | 300,000,000 m/s         |

## 🔹 7.4 Experiment – Measuring Speed

**Aim:** To measure the speed of a toy car.

**Equipment:**

* Ramp
* Toy car
* Ruler / measuring tape
* Stopwatch

**Method:**

1. Measure distance down the ramp (e.g., 1.5 m).
2. Release car and time how long it takes to reach the bottom.
3. Repeat 3 times, find **average time**.
4. Calculate speed:
   [
   v = \dfrac{d}{t}
   ]

**Example:**
d = 1.5 m, t = 0.75 s →
[
v = 1.5 ÷ 0.75 = 2 , \text{m/s}
]

✅ The toy car moves at 2 m/s.
