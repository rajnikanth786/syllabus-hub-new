# **GCSE Year 7 – Graph Drawing (Detailed Notes)**

Graph drawing is an important skill in Maths and Science. It helps us show information clearly so we can spot patterns, compare data, and make predictions. These notes will guide you step-by-step on how to draw accurate, neat graphs.

---

## **1. What Is a Graph?**

A **graph** is a visual way of showing information (data). It helps us understand relationships between two variables.

Examples:
- How temperature changes during the day  
- How long it takes to run different distances  
- How plant height changes over weeks  

---

## **2. Types of Graphs You Will Use in Year 7**

### **a. Line Graph**
Used when the data changes over time or shows a continuous change.  
**Example:** Temperature over 24 hours.

### **b. Bar Chart**
Used for comparing categories.  
**Example:** Number of students in different clubs.

### **c. Pie Chart** *(Less common in graphs you draw by hand at this stage)*  
Shows percentages or parts of a whole.

### **d. Scatter Graphs** *(Introduced later)*  
Shows how two variables are related.

---

## **3. Key Vocabulary**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Axis (axes)** | The two lines on the graph (x-axis → horizontal, y-axis → vertical). |
| **Origin** | The point where both axes meet (0,0). |
| **Scale** | The numbers you choose for the axis (e.g., counting in 1s, 2s, 5s). |
| **Plotting points** | Marking a point using coordinates *(x, y)*. |
| **Coordinates** | A pair of numbers showing the position of a point. |
| **Label** | The name of each axis that explains what it shows. |

---

## **4. Steps to Draw a Line Graph (Step-By-Step)**

### **Step 1: Draw the Axes**
- Draw a **horizontal line** (x-axis).
- Draw a **vertical line** (y-axis).
- Make sure they meet at 90°.

### **Step 2: Label Each Axis**
- X-axis → the independent variable (the one you choose or control).  
  *Example:* Time, distance, days.
- Y-axis → the dependent variable (the one that changes).  
  *Example:* Temperature, height, speed.

### **Step 3: Choose a Suitable Scale**
- Look at the smallest and largest number in your data.
- Choose a scale that:
  - Fits all your data
  - Is easy to count (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s)
- Keep the spacing equal.

### **Step 4: Plot the Points**
- Each point has an **(x, y)** value.  
- Start at the x-value, move up to the y-value, and place a small neat cross (×) or dot.

### **Step 5: Draw the Line**
- Join the points with a **straight line** if the data is continuous (like temperature over time).  
- Do **not** join the points if you are drawing a bar chart.

### **Step 6: Title and Key**
- Add a title explaining what the graph is about.  
  *Example:* “Plant Growth Over 7 Days”.
- Add a **key** only if more than one line is shown.

## **5. Example: Drawing a Line Graph**

**Data: Temperature during the day**

| Time (hours) | Temperature (°C) |
|--------------|------------------|
| 6 am | 10 |
| 9 am | 14 |
| 12 pm | 18 |
| 3 pm | 20 |
| 6 pm | 17 |
| 9 pm | 13 |

### Steps:
1. X-axis → Time  
2. Y-axis → Temperature  
3. Scale: x-axis in 3-hour intervals, y-axis in 2°C intervals  
4. Plot the points:
   - (6, 10)
   - (9, 14)
   - (12, 18)
   - (15, 20)
   - (18, 17)
   - (21, 13)
5. Join the points to show change over time  
6. Add title: **“Temperature Throughout the Day”**

---

## **6. Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- ❌ Uneven scales  
- ❌ Forgetting to label axes  
- ❌ Not starting scales at 0 when needed  
- ❌ Using curved/rough lines instead of straight lines  
- ❌ Points drawn too big  
- ❌ No title

|--------|-------------|
| Apple | 30 |
| Banana | 25 |
| Orange | 15 |
| Grapes | 10 |

---

### **C. Plot These Coordinates**
Plot the points and join them to form a shape:  
(1,1), (4,1), (4,3), (1,3), (1,1)

---

## **8. Summary**

- Graphs show data visually.
- Always label axes and choose a clear scale.
- Plot accurately and draw neat lines.
- Use line graphs for continuous data, bar charts for categories.

# ✅ **SECTION C — Plotting Coordinates (With Answers)**

## **Question C**
Plot these points and join them to form a shape:  
(1,1), (4,1), (4,3), (1,3), (1,1)

---

## **Model Answer (Shape Description)**

The shape formed is a **rectangle**.

### **Correct Plotting**
- Start at (1,1)  
- Move to (4,1)  
- Move up to (4,3)  
- Move left to (1,3)  
- Return to (1,1)

### **Reasoning**
- Opposite sides are equal:
  - Horizontal distance: 4−1 = **3 units**
  - Vertical distance: 3−1 = **2 units**
- ✔ All right angles  
- ✔ Closed shape

## **Marking Guide (Total 5 Marks)**

| Requirement | Marks |
|-------------|--------|
| All 5 points correctly plotted | 3 |
| Lines correctly joined | 1 |
| Correct shape identified (rectangle) | 1 |

# ✅ **Additional Teacher Notes: Common Misconceptions**

### **1. Incorrect scales**
Students often:
- Start the scale at a random number  
- Use uneven intervals  
- Switch between counting in 1s and 2s

**Fix:** Remind them scales must be *even and consistent*.

---

### **2. Mixing up axes**
Students may put time on the y-axis.

**Fix:**  
- X-axis → independent variable  
- Y-axis → dependent variable

---

### **3. Plotting points incorrectly**
A common error:  
Plotting (3,8) as (8,3).

**Fix:**  
Teach: **“Along the corridor (x), up the stairs (y)”**

---

### **4. Overdrawing or using circles instead of crosses**
Encourage small, neat crosses.

---

### **5. Forgetting titles and labels**
Graphs must be understandable without the data table.
