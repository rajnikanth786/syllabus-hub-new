---

## 🔹 5.1 What Is Density?

> **Density** is how much **mass** there is in a given **volume** of a substance.

It tells us **how tightly packed** the particles are.

[
\textbf{Density (ρ) = Mass (m) ÷ Volume (V)}
]

---

### 📘 Definition

Density is the **mass per unit volume** of a substance.

| Symbol                      | Quantity | Unit                                                                    | Formula                 |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ( \rho ) (Greek letter rho) | Density  | kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³) or grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm³) | ( \rho = \dfrac{m}{V} ) |
| ( m )                       | Mass     | kilograms (kg) or grams (g)                                             | ( m = \rho × V )        |
| ( V )                       | Volume   | cubic metres (m³) or cubic centimetres (cm³)                            | ( V = \dfrac{m}{\rho} ) |

---

### 💡 Key Idea

* Substances with **particles close together** have **high density**.
* Substances with **particles far apart** have **low density**.

---

## 🔹 5.2 Visualising Density with the Particle Model

| State      | Particle Arrangement               | Density          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Solid**  | Tightly packed, regular pattern    | High density     |
| **Liquid** | Close together, random arrangement | Medium density   |
| **Gas**    | Far apart, move freely             | Very low density |

**Diagram idea:**

* Solid → particles touching closely
* Liquid → slightly apart
* Gas → very spread out

---

### 🌍 Everyday Meaning of Density

* A heavy metal block feels heavier than a sponge of the same size because it has **more mass per volume**.
* **Oil floats on water** because it is **less dense**.
* **Hot air balloons rise** because **heated air is less dense** than cool air.

---

## 🔹 5.3 Units of Density

| Unit    | Equivalent                 | Common use         |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| kg/m³   | kilograms per cubic metre  | SI (standard) unit |
| g/cm³   | grams per cubic centimetre | Laboratory use     |
| 1 g/cm³ | = 1000 kg/m³               | Conversion factor  |

**Conversion:**
[
1 , \text{g/cm³} = 1000 , \text{kg/m³}
]

---

### ⚙️ Example Conversion

If density = 0.8 g/cm³
[
0.8 × 1000 = 800 , \text{kg/m³}
]

---

## 🔹 5.4 Calculating Density (Examples)

### ✏️ Example 1 – Finding Density

A block has a **mass** of 200 g and a **volume** of 50 cm³.
Find its density.

[
\rho = \dfrac{m}{V} = \dfrac{200}{50} = 4 , \text{g/cm³}
]

**Answer:** 4 g/cm³

---

### ✏️ Example 2 – Finding Volume

A liquid has a density of 1.2 g/cm³. Its mass is 36 g.
[
V = \dfrac{m}{\rho} = \dfrac{36}{1.2} = 30 , \text{cm³}
]

**Answer:** 30 cm³

---

### ✏️ Example 3 – Finding Mass

A metal cube has volume 10 cm³ and density 7.8 g/cm³.
[
m = \rho × V = 7.8 × 10 = 78 , \text{g}
]

**Answer:** 78 g

## 🔹 5.5 Typical Densities of Common Substances

| Substance | State  | Density (g/cm³) | Comment                        |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Air       | Gas    | 0.0013          | Very low – particles far apart |
| Water     | Liquid | 1.0             | Standard reference             |
| Ice       | Solid  | 0.92            | Floats on water                |
| Wood      | Solid  | 0.6–0.9         | Floats on water                |
| Aluminium | Solid  | 2.7             | Light metal                    |
| Iron      | Solid  | 7.9             | Heavier metal                  |
| Copper    | Solid  | 8.9             | Dense metal                    |
| Lead      | Solid  | 11.3            | Very dense                     |
| Oil       | Liquid | 0.8–0.9         | Floats on water                |

---

## 🔹 5.6 Density and Floating or Sinking

Whether an object **floats or sinks** depends on **density**.

| Condition                  | What Happens | Example               |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Object density **< water** | Floats       | Wood, oil             |
| Object density **> water** | Sinks        | Iron, stone           |
| Object density **= water** | Suspended    | Some fish, submarines |

**Key concept:**
The **upthrust (buoyant force)** equals the **weight of the displaced fluid**.
If upthrust = weight → object floats (Archimedes’ principle – extension idea).

---

## 🔹 5.7 Measuring Density of Regular Solids

**Example: a cube or block**

### Equipment:

* Balance (to measure **mass**)
* Ruler or vernier (to measure **lengths**)

### Method:

1. Measure **mass (m)** using a balance.
2. Measure **length, width, height (cm)** with a ruler.
3. Calculate **volume**:
   [
   V = \text{length × width × height}
   ]
4. Calculate **density**:
   [
   \rho = \dfrac{m}{V}
   ]

### Example:

A metal block has sides of 2 cm and a mass of 32 g.
[
V = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 , \text{cm³}
]
[
\rho = \dfrac{32}{8} = 4 , \text{g/cm³}
]

✅ **Answer:** 4 g/cm³

---

## 🔹 5.8 Measuring Density of Irregular Solids (Displacement Method)

**Example: A stone or key**

### Equipment:

* Balance
* Measuring cylinder
* Water

### Method:

1. Measure **mass (m)** of the object.
2. Fill the **measuring cylinder** with water and record starting volume ( V_1 ).
3. Gently drop the object in and record new volume ( V_2 ).
4. Find **volume of object**:
   [
   V = V_2 - V_1
   ]
5. Calculate **density**:
   [
   \rho = \dfrac{m}{V}
   ]

### Example:

Mass = 60 g, Water level rises from 40 cm³ to 50 cm³
[
V = 50 - 40 = 10 , \text{cm³}
]
[
\rho = \dfrac{60}{10} = 6 , \text{g/cm³}
]

✅ **Answer:** 6 g/cm³

---

## 🔹 5.9 Measuring Density of a Liquid

### Equipment:

* Measuring cylinder
* Balance
* Liquid sample

### Method:

1. Place cylinder on balance and **zero** it.
2. Pour in a known **volume (V)** of liquid (e.g., 50 cm³).
3. Record the **mass (m)** directly.
4. Calculate density:
   [
   \rho = \dfrac{m}{V}
   ]

**Example:**
Mass = 45 g, Volume = 50 cm³
[
\rho = \dfrac{45}{50} = 0.9 , \text{g/cm³}
]

✅ **Answer:** 0.9 g/cm³ (the liquid will float on water)

---

## 🔹 5.10 Density and Temperature

* As temperature **increases**, particles move further apart → **density decreases**.
* That’s why **hot air rises** (less dense) and **cold air sinks** (denser).

**Example:**
Hot water rises in a kettle; cooler water sinks – sets up **convection currents**.

---

## 🔹 5.11 Graphing Density

When you plot **mass (y-axis)** vs **volume (x-axis)**:

* The graph is a **straight line through the origin**.
* The **slope (gradient)** gives the **density**.

[
\text{Gradient} = \dfrac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \text{density}
]

## 🔹 5.12 Everyday Uses of Density

| Situation        | Explanation                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ship design      | Steel ships float because they enclose air, lowering average density |
| Oil spills       | Oil floats on water → difficult to clean                             |
| Balloons         | Hot air is less dense → balloon rises                                |
| Weather patterns | Warm, less dense air rises → wind and storms                         |
| Icebergs         | Ice less dense than water → floats                                   |
| Gold testing     | Density helps detect pure gold (19.3 g/cm³)                          |
