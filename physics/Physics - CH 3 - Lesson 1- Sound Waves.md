# 🔊 **Lesson 1: Sound Waves**

---

## 🔹 1.1 What Is Sound?

> **Sound** is a type of **wave** that is produced when **objects vibrate**.
> These vibrations travel through materials (like air, water, or solids) to reach our ears.

When sound waves reach your ear, they make your **eardrum vibrate**, and your brain interprets these vibrations as **sound**.

---

### 💡 Key Idea:

* **Vibrations** → create **sound waves**
* **Sound waves** → travel through **a medium**
* **No medium = no sound** (sound cannot travel in vacuum)

---

## 🔹 1.2 How Sound Travels

Sound travels as **vibrations of particles**.
Each particle **pushes and pulls** its neighbours, passing energy along.

**Example:**
When a guitar string vibrates → it moves air particles → they pass the vibration to the next → sound travels to your ear.

---

### 🌀 Sound wave type:

> Sound travels as a **longitudinal wave.**

In a **longitudinal wave**, particles:

* Move **back and forth** (parallel) to the direction of the wave.
* Form **compressions** (particles close together) and **rarefactions** (particles far apart).

---

**Diagram (description):**

```
Compressions: |||||||||   (high pressure)
Rarefactions: | | | | |   (low pressure)
→ Wave direction →
```

---

## 🔹 1.3 Sound Needs a Medium

Sound needs **matter** (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel.

| Medium     | Does sound travel?  | Example           |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Solid**  | ✅ Yes, very fast    | Steel, wall, wood |
| **Liquid** | ✅ Yes, medium speed | Water             |
| **Gas**    | ✅ Yes, slower       | Air               |
| **Vacuum** | ❌ No                | Space (no air)    |

That’s why **astronauts in space** cannot hear explosions — there’s **no air** to carry the sound waves!

---

### 🌍 Example

* You can hear people through a wall because sound travels **faster and better in solids** than air.

---

## 🔹 1.4 Speed of Sound

The speed of sound depends on the **medium** and its **particle spacing**.

| Medium          | Approximate speed (m/s) | Notes                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Air (room temp) | 343 m/s                 | Slower – particles far apart         |
| Water           | 1,480 m/s               | Faster – particles closer            |
| Steel           | 5,960 m/s               | Very fast – particles tightly packed |
| Vacuum          | 0 m/s                   | No sound (no particles)              |

**Key point:**
Sound travels **fastest in solids**, **slowest in gases**.

---

## 🔹 1.5 Frequency and Pitch

**Frequency** = how many sound waves (vibrations) pass a point each second.

[
\textbf{Frequency (f) = number of waves ÷ time}
]

| Symbol | Quantity  | Unit       |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| ( f )  | Frequency | Hertz (Hz) |

* **1 Hz = 1 vibration per second**
* **Higher frequency → higher pitch**
* **Lower frequency → lower pitch**

---

### 🎵 Examples:

| Sound       | Frequency  | Pitch                           |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Deep drum   | 50 Hz      | Low                             |
| Human voice | 200–800 Hz | Medium                          |
| Whistle     | 5,000 Hz   | High                            |
| Dog whistle | >20,000 Hz | Very high (inaudible to humans) |

---

## 🔹 1.6 Amplitude and Loudness

**Amplitude** = maximum height of vibration (how far particles move).
It controls the **loudness** of sound.

* **Large amplitude** → louder sound
* **Small amplitude** → quieter sound

---

### 🎤 Example:

When you turn up the volume:

* The speaker cone vibrates **further** → air particles move more → louder sound.

---

### 📊 Quick comparison:

| Feature       | Changes                 | Effect               |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Amplitude** | How big vibrations are  | Changes **loudness** |
| **Frequency** | How fast vibrations are | Changes **pitch**    |

---

## 🔹 1.7 Waveform Diagrams

A **waveform** shows sound as a line graph (Amplitude vs Time).

**Diagram (described):**

```
High amplitude = loud sound
Low amplitude = quiet sound
High frequency = high pitch (waves closer)
Low frequency = low pitch (waves wider apart)
```

---

## 🔹 1.8 Echoes and Reflection of Sound

> Sound can **reflect** off surfaces — this is called an **echo**.

**Hard surfaces** (walls, cliffs, buildings) reflect sound well.
**Soft materials** (curtains, carpets) absorb sound, reducing echoes.

---

### 🌋 Example:

* Echoes in caves or empty halls.
* Bats use **echolocation** — send out sounds and listen for echoes to locate prey.

---

### Formula for Echo (distance method):

[
\text{Speed} = \dfrac{2 × \text{distance}}{\text{time for echo}}
]

---

## 🔹 1.9 Absorption of Sound

* **Soft, rough surfaces** absorb vibrations (reduce echo).
* **Hard, smooth surfaces** reflect sound.

| Surface         | Effect                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Curtain, carpet | Absorb sound           |
| Brick wall      | Reflect sound          |
| Foam            | Absorb sound           |
| Metal sheet     | Reflect sound strongly |

Used in:

* Recording studios
* Cinema walls
* Noise reduction panels

---

## 🔹 1.10 How We Hear Sound (Human Ear)

### Sound path:

1. **Outer ear** collects vibrations.
2. **Ear canal** carries vibrations to the **eardrum**.
3. **Eardrum** vibrates and moves three small bones (ossicles): hammer, anvil, stirrup.
4. These amplify vibrations into the **cochlea** (fluid-filled).
5. **Hair cells** in cochlea send signals via **auditory nerve** to the brain.
6. The **brain** interprets these signals as **sound**.

---

### ⚙️ Summary:

Vibrations → Eardrum → Bones → Cochlea → Brain → Sound perceived.

---

**Diagram (described):**
Ear structure labelled:

* Outer ear → ear canal → eardrum → ossicles → cochlea → auditory nerve.

---

## 🔹 1.11 Sound and Energy Transfer

Sound transfers **energy**, not matter.
Particles vibrate and pass **kinetic energy** to neighbouring particles.

That’s why the **sound weakens** (fades) as energy spreads out — this is called **dissipation**.

---

## 🔹 1.12 Hearing Range

Humans can hear between **20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz)**.

| Species   | Hearing Range (Hz)            |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Humans    | 20 – 20,000                   |
| Dogs      | 15 – 45,000                   |
| Bats      | 1,000 – 120,000               |
| Dolphins  | 150 – 150,000                 |
| Elephants | 1 – 20 (can hear low rumbles) |

Sounds above human range = **ultrasound**
Sounds below = **infrasound**

---

## 🔹 1.13 Ultrasound Uses (Extension)

Ultrasound = **high-frequency sound (>20,000 Hz)**

| Use                    | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Medical scanning**   | Creates images of unborn babies       |
| **SONAR**              | Finds depth or detects submarines     |
| **Cleaning**           | High-frequency vibrations remove dirt |
| **Industrial testing** | Finds cracks inside metals            |

---

## 🔹 1.14 Experiment: Investigating Pitch and Loudness

**Aim:** To explore how frequency and amplitude affect sound.

**Equipment:** Signal generator, speaker, oscilloscope (or phone app).

**Steps:**

1. Change frequency → observe pitch change.
2. Change amplitude → observe loudness change.
3. Record observations.

**Observation:**

* Higher frequency → higher pitch
* Greater amplitude → louder sound

---

## 🔹 1.15 Speed of Sound Experiment (Optional)

**Aim:** To measure speed of sound in air.

**Method 1 – Echo method:**

1. Stand 50 m from a wall.
2. Clap and time the echo with stopwatch.
3. Time = time for sound to go to wall and back.
   [
   \text{Speed} = \dfrac{2 × \text{distance}}{\text{time}}
   ]

**Method 2 – Microphone method:**
Use two microphones at known distance apart and measure delay between signals.
