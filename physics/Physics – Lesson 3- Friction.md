## 🔹 3.1 What Is Friction?

**Friction** is a **contact force** that **opposes motion** between two surfaces that touch.
It always acts in the **opposite direction** to movement.

> 💡 **Definition:**
> Friction is a force that resists sliding or moving of one surface over another.

### ⚙️ Everyday examples

| Situation      | Type of friction             | What it does                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Walking        | Between shoes and ground     | Helps grip the floor so you don’t slip |
| Car brakes     | Between brake pads and wheel | Slows the car down                     |
| Writing        | Between pen/pencil and paper | Lets you write or draw                 |
| Sliding on ice | Very little friction         | Causes slipping                        |
| Rubbing hands  | Surface friction             | Produces heat                          |

## 🔹 3.2 Direction of Friction

Friction always acts **opposite** to motion.

Example:
If you push a box to the right, **friction acts left**.
If you pull something upward on a slope, **friction acts downward**.

## 🔹 3.3 Types of Friction

| Type                           | Description                                                        | Example                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Static friction**            | Keeps an object **still** until enough force is applied to move it | Pushing a heavy box that doesn’t move yet |
| **Sliding friction (kinetic)** | Acts when surfaces **slide** past each other                       | Ice skates gliding                        |
| **Rolling friction**           | Acts when objects **roll** over surfaces                           | Car tires, ball bearings                  |
| **Fluid friction (drag)**      | Resistance when moving through **liquids or gases**                | Air resistance, water drag                |

---

## 🔹 3.4 Factors Affecting Friction

| Factor                                      | Effect                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Surface roughness**                       | Rougher → **more friction**; smoother → **less friction**                            |
| **Weight/force pressing surfaces together** | Heavier object → **more friction**                                                   |
| **Contact area**                            | Larger area doesn’t always mean more friction — depends on pressure and surface type |
| **Type of material**                        | Rubber on concrete has more friction than ice on steel                               |
| **Lubrication**                             | Oil or grease **reduces friction** between moving parts                              |

---

### 💡 Example:

* A **bicycle chain** needs oil to reduce friction and prevent wear.
* **Shoes** need high friction (grip) to stop slipping on the floor.

---

## 🔹 3.5 Useful vs Unwanted Friction

| **Useful Friction**       | **Unwanted Friction**                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Walking or running – grip | Engine parts rubbing – causes wear        |
| Car tires on road         | Heat loss in machines                     |
| Brakes stopping cars      | Friction slows moving parts unnecessarily |
| Nails holding wood        | Friction wastes energy as heat or sound   |

---

### 🔧 Reducing unwanted friction:

* Use **lubricants** (oil, grease, graphite).
* Make surfaces **smoother** or **polished**.
* Use **ball bearings** or **rollers**.
* Use **streamlined shapes** to reduce **air resistance**.
* Add **wheels** to reduce sliding friction to rolling friction.

---

## 🔹 3.6 Friction and Heat

When two surfaces rub together, **kinetic energy** (movement energy) changes into **heat energy**.
This is why:

* Your hands get warm when rubbed.
* Car brakes become very hot after sudden braking.
* Machines need **cooling systems** and **oil** to handle heat from friction.

---

## 🔹 3.7 Air Resistance (a Type of Friction)

Air resistance (also called **drag**) is the **frictional force** between air particles and a moving object.

* Acts **opposite to motion**.
* **Increases** with speed.
* **Depends on shape, surface area, and smoothness**.

| Object            | Air Resistance Effect               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Parachute         | High air resistance – slows descent |
| Streamlined car   | Low air resistance – moves faster   |
| Cyclist upright   | More air drag                       |
| Cyclist crouching | Less drag → higher speed            |

---

### ✈️ Reducing Air Resistance

* Streamlined shapes (cars, airplanes, fish, birds).
* Smooth surfaces.
* Pointed noses and sloped backs.

---

### 📉 Terminal Velocity (Extension idea)

As a falling object speeds up, air resistance increases until it equals the weight.
Then, forces are **balanced**, and the object falls at a **constant speed** — its **terminal velocity**.

---

## 🔹 3.8 Friction on Different Surfaces (Simple Experiment)

**Aim:** To investigate how friction changes with surface type.

**Equipment:**

* Wooden block or toy car
* Spring balance
* Different surfaces (table, carpet, sandpaper, smooth board)

**Method:**

1. Attach spring balance to block.
2. Pull block steadily and note force needed to move it.
3. Repeat on each surface.
4. Compare results.

**Expected results:**
Rougher surfaces (like sandpaper) need **more force** → **greater friction**.

**Graph:**
Plot *force (N)* on y-axis vs *surface type* on x-axis.

---

## 🔹 3.9 How to Increase Friction (when you want it)

* Use **rough surfaces** (tire treads, shoe soles).
* Use **grippy materials** (rubber).
* Increase **normal force** (more weight → more grip).
* Design **grooves** in shoes and tires to push water away and maintain contact.

* **Newton’s laws** (forces can balance or oppose motion)
* **Energy** (work done against friction → heat)
