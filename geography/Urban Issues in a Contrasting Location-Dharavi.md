## 2. Key Urban Issues in Dharavi
### 2.1. Overcrowding
- **Cause**: Dharavi's population density is extremely high, leading to a shortage of space and poor living conditions.
- **Impact**: 
  - Limited space for housing.
  - Lack of privacy and exposure to health risks.
  - Limited access to basic services like water, electricity, and sanitation.
  
### 2.2. Inadequate Infrastructure
- **Housing**: Most of the houses are made of poorly constructed materials, with limited ventilation and often lack basic amenities like clean water and sewage systems.
- **Electricity**: Electricity is irregular and often stolen, leading to dangerous conditions such as fire hazards.
- **Water Supply**: Only a few communal taps exist, and water supply is unreliable.
- **Sanitation**: Lack of proper sewage systems, leading to open drains and poor sanitation, contributing to health problems.

### 2.3. Poor Health and Sanitation
- **Health Risks**: Poor sanitation and overcrowding increase the spread of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis.
- **Waste Management**: Waste disposal is not well-organized, with open drains and unmanaged garbage piles. This worsens the living conditions and contributes to the spread of diseases.

### 2.4. Pollution
- **Air Pollution**: High levels of air pollution from industries and waste burning.
- **Water Pollution**: Rivers and local water bodies near Dharavi suffer from pollution due to untreated sewage and industrial waste being dumped into them.
- **Noise Pollution**: The area is often noisy due to traffic, industrial activity, and the constant movement of people.

### 2.5. Informal Economy
- **Employment**: Many residents work in the informal economy, particularly in small-scale industries such as recycling, pottery-making, textile production, and food processing.
- **Challenges**: 
  - Unregulated working conditions.
  - Low wages and lack of job security.
  - Hazardous working environments.

### 2.6. Lack of Education and Skills
- **Limited Access to Education**: Many children in Dharavi have limited access to formal education due to overcrowded schools, poverty, and the need for children to work.
- **Low Skill Levels**: Many adults in Dharavi work in low-skilled jobs with little opportunity for further education or vocational training.

## 3. Case Study: Urban Renewal Efforts in Dharavi
### 3.1. Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)
- **Objective**: Aimed at improving the living conditions of Dharavi's residents by providing modern housing, better infrastructure, and improving access to services.
- **Challenges**:
  - The project has faced criticism for displacing residents without adequate compensation.

  - Slow progress and corruption issues have also hindered the success of the project.

### 3.2. Local Initiatives
- **Community-Based Projects**: Many local organizations and NGOs work in Dharavi to improve sanitation, provide healthcare, and support education.
- **Recycling Initiatives**: Dharavi's recycling industry is a notable example of informal recycling practices. Small-scale operations recycle plastic, metal, and other materials, reducing waste in the city.

## 4. Comparison with a More Developed Urban Area
