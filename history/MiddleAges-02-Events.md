# Where does power really lie in the Middle Ages?

**Context for pupils:** Year 7 — this file explains how different events help us understand the *broader concepts of power* (who controls people, land and resources, and how that control can change). Pupils will study events such as the Black Death, Magna Carta, the Norman Conquest, the Investiture Controversy, the Crusades, the Peasants' Revolt, the growth of towns and guilds, and the Hundred Years' War to explore power in practice.

## Overview — What do we mean by *power*?

Power in history can take many forms. When we ask *"where does power lie?"* we mean:

* **Political power** — the ability to make and enforce laws (kings, lords, governments).
* **Religious power** — control based on belief, ritual and authority (the Church, the Pope).
* **Economic power** — control of wealth, land, trade and labour (nobles, merchants, landlords).
* **Social/cultural power** — influence over people’s values, status and everyday life (customs, education, family, guilds).
* **Military power** — ability to wage war or defend territory (knights, armies, castles).

Power is rarely concentrated in just one person or institution — it is contested, shared and changes over time. The events below show how that works in the Middle Ages.

## 1. The Norman Conquest (1066) — centralising royal power

**What happened?** William of Normandy invaded England in 1066 and defeated Harold at the Battle of Hastings. William claimed all land by conquest and redistributed it to his followers.

**How it shows power:**

* **Political & military power:** William strengthened royal control by making landholdings depend on loyalty to the king. He created a feudal system that tied nobles to him.
* **Administrative power:** The Domesday Book (1086) recorded land and taxes — this was a tool of central power and control.

**Big idea for pupils:** Conquest can change who controls land and resources quickly — kings can become more powerful when they reorganise land and administration.

---

## 2. The Investiture Controversy (11th–12th centuries) — king vs pope

**What happened?** A long conflict over who could appoint bishops and senior church officials — secular rulers (kings) or the Pope.

**How it shows power:**

* **Religious vs political authority:** Both the Church and kings wanted to control appointments because bishops ruled land and influenced people.
* **Checks on royal power:** The Church could challenge kings by refusing to cooperate, or by excommunicating them.

**Big idea:** Religious institutions could rival political rulers — power often required legitimation by the Church.

---

## 3. Magna Carta (1215) — limits on the king

**What happened?** English barons forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, a set of promises limiting royal power and protecting barons’ rights.

**How it shows power:**

* **Power negotiation:** Even a king had to negotiate with powerful nobles — law could be used to limit rulers.
* **Foundation for later rights:** While the charter served elite interests at first, it introduced the idea that rulers are bound by laws.

**Big idea:** Power can be constrained by agreements and laws — rulers are not always absolute.

---

## 4. The Black Death (1347–1351) — a social and economic shock

**What happened?** A plague pandemic that wiped out a large portion of Europe’s population.

**How it shows power:**

* **Economic power shifts:** Massive labour shortages made surviving peasants and workers more valuable — many demanded higher wages and better conditions.
* **Breakdown of old systems:** Feudal obligations and strict social order were weakened in many areas because landlords needed workers.
* **Social unrest and bargaining power:** Peasant revolts and negotiations with lords rose (e.g., the English Peasants’ Revolt of 1381 was partly rooted in post-plague tensions).

**Big idea:** Major crises can rapidly change who holds power by altering resources (people, food, wealth). The Black Death shifted economic power from landowners towards labourers, at least temporarily.

---

## 5. Growth of towns, trade and guilds — new economic power

**What happened?** From the High to Late Middle Ages towns grew; merchants and craftsmen organised into guilds.

**How it shows power:**

* **Economic independence:** Townspeople could earn wealth and sometimes buy freedoms from feudal obligations.
* **Collective bargaining:** Guilds protected members’ income and standards; they regulated trade and exerted political influence in towns.

**Big idea:** Economic power can create political power — new groups (merchants, guilds) changed the social order and pressured kings and nobles.

---

## 6. The Crusades (1096–13th centuries) — religiously motivated power projection

**What happened?** Military campaigns to the Holy Land encouraged by Popes, involving kings, nobles and knights.

**How it shows power:**

* **Papal authority:** The Pope mobilised nobles across Europe — religion could unite political forces.
* **Redistribution of resources:** Some nobles sold land or mortgaged assets to fund crusading, changing local power balances.

**Big idea:** Religion could be used as a tool to assert power across borders and to mobilise resources and people.

---

## 7. The Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) — kings and national power

**What happened?** A long conflict mainly between England and France that involved new military methods and taxation.

**How it shows power:**

* **State-building:** The need to fund wars helped centralise royal power and taxation systems.
* **Military change:** Professional armies and use of infantry changed the power of the feudal knightly class.

**Big idea:** Warfare and taxation can strengthen monarchs and create more centralised states.

---

## 8. Peasants’ Revolt (1381) and similar uprisings — popular power

**What happened?** In England and elsewhere, peasants sometimes rebelled against taxes, forced labour rules and inequality.

**How it shows power:**

* **Collective threat:** Even poorly armed peasants could challenge elites, forcing concessions or repression.
* **Visible limits:** Revolts exposed weaknesses in elite rule and could trigger legal or economic changes.

**Big idea:** Ordinary people had power through numbers and disruption — social order depends on consent or force.

## Themes and Concepts to Explore with Pupils

1. **Contested power:** Power is rarely absolute; kings, church and people often competed.
2. **Legitimacy:** Who makes rules, and why do people follow them? Religion, tradition and law are sources of legitimacy.
3. **Resources and bargaining:** Control of land, labour and money underpins power.
4. **Change through crisis:** Epidemics, wars and economic shifts can change social hierarchies fast.
5. **Institutions matter:** The Church, monarchies, towns and guilds create structures that preserve, share or challenge power.

## Classroom Activities (with outcomes)

### A. Source analysis — "Who held power?"

* Provide pupils with short primary/secondary extracts (Magna Carta clauses, a priest’s account, a peasant petition, a merchant’s letter, a Black Death poem).
* **Task:** For each source, identify which kind of power is shown (political/religious/economic/social) and explain why (PEEL paragraph).
* **Outcome:** Pupils practise evidence-based argument.

### B. Role-play debate — "King vs Pope vs People"

* Split class into three groups (King, Church, People). Give each group facts and demands.
* Simulate negotiations after a big event (e.g., after the Black Death). Can they agree a new social contract?
* **Outcome:** Pupils learn how bargaining changes power.

### C. Mini-essay — "Which event changed power most?"

* Pupils choose one event (Black Death, Magna Carta, Crusades) and explain the short- and long-term effects on power.
* **Outcome:** Practice cause-and-effect and judgement.

### D. Timeline creation

* Pupils place events on a timeline and annotate how each event shifted power (who gained/lost power).
* **Outcome:** Visual understanding of long-term change.

---

## Assessment questions (short and extended)

## Further reading / teacher notes

* Suggest simple student-friendly sources and primary documents (e.g., translated Magna Carta extracts, contemporary accounts of the Black Death, short biographies of King John and Pope Gregory VII).
* Differentiation: provide scaffolded sentence starters for lower ability pupils and challenge tasks (compare two events) for higher ability.

---

### Final note for teachers

Use these events not as isolated facts but as evidence to explore *how and why* power shifts. Encourage pupils to think about *who benefits* and *who loses* when power changes — and why some changes last while others are temporary.
