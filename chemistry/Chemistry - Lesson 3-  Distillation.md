# ⭐️ **GCSE Chemistry (Year 7) – Distillation Explained**

## 🧪 **What is Distillation?**

Distillation is a **separation technique** used to split a **liquid mixture** into its individual parts by **heating**, **evaporating**, and then **condensing** the substances.
It works because **different liquids have different boiling points**.

For example:

* Water boils at **100°C**
* Ethanol boils at **78°C**

This difference lets us separate them.

---

## 🔥 **Why Do We Use Distillation?**

Distillation helps us:

* Separate **impure liquids**
* Purify **sea water into fresh water**
* Separate **alcohol from water**
* Produce fuels and chemicals in industry
* Obtain **solvent-free** samples for experiments

# 🧩 **Key Scientific Ideas**

### ✔ Different substances boil at **different temperatures**

The liquid with the **lowest boiling point** evaporates first.

### ✔ Evaporation and condensation

Distillation relies on:

1. **Evaporation** — turning liquid → gas
2. **Condensation** — turning gas → liquid

### ✔ A condenser cools down the vapour

Cold water flows around the condenser to turn vapour back into liquid.

# ⚗️ **The Distillation Apparatus**

A standard distillation setup contains:

* **Heat source** (Bunsen burner or electric heater)
* **Round-bottom or boiling flask**
* **Thermometer**
* **Condenser** (Liebig condenser)
* **Receiving flask**
* **Water in/out tubes** for cooling

---

# 🧭 **Step-by-Step: How Distillation Works**

## **1. Heating the mixture**

The mixture is placed in the boiling flask and heated.
As the temperature rises, the liquid with the **lowest boiling point** evaporates first.

## **2. Evaporation**

The evaporating substance changes from **liquid → gas**.
The thermometer shows when this substance is boiling.

## **3. Vapour enters the condenser**

The hot vapour travels up and into the condenser.

## **4. Cooling and condensation**

Cold water constantly flows around the outside of the condenser.
This cools the vapour, turning it back into a **liquid**.

## **5. Collection**

The pure condensed liquid (called the **distillate**) drips into the receiving flask.

# 🧂 **Example: Separating Salt Water**

Salt water is heated → water evaporates → water vapour condenses → pure water is collected.

The salt **does not evaporate** because its boiling point is extremely high.

---

# 🧪 **Types of Distillation**

### **1. Simple Distillation**

Used when separating:

* A liquid from a solid (e.g., salt water)
* One liquid from another when their boiling points are very different

### **2. Fractional Distillation**

Used when separating:

* Mixtures of many liquids (e.g., crude oil)
* Liquids with **similar boiling points**

A **fractionating column** improves separation.

---

# 🧠 **Common Misconceptions (to address with students)**

* **“All liquids boil at the same temperature.”**
  No—each liquid has its own boiling point.

* **“Salt evaporates with water.”**
  It doesn’t—salt has a very high boiling point.

* **“Distillation filters liquids.”**
  It separates by **boiling and condensation**, not filtering.

# 🎓 **Key Words**

| Word              | Definition                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Boiling point** | The temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas |
| **Evaporation**   | Liquid turning into gas at any temperature      |
| **Condensation**  | Gas turning back into liquid                    |
| **Distillate**    | The purified liquid collected                   |
| **Condenser**     | Equipment used to cool hot gas back into liquid |
| **Mixture**       | Two or more substances not chemically joined    |

### **Question 1**

Why is a condenser needed in distillation?
**Answer:** To cool down the vapour so it condenses back into a liquid.

---

### **Question 2**

Explain why water evaporates before salt during the distillation of saltwater.
