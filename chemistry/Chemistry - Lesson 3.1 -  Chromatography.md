# 🧪 **What is Chromatography?**

Chromatography is a **separation technique** used to split a mixture of colours or chemicals into individual substances.
It helps us **identify** what the mixture is made of.

Examples:

* Separating ink colours in pens
* Testing food dyes
* Identifying drugs or chemicals in forensic science

# 📄 **What is a Chromatogram?**

A **chromatogram** is the **final result** produced after chromatography.
It shows **separate spots or bands** representing different substances.

---

# 🧩 **How Chromatography Works**

1. A spot of the mixture is placed on **chromatography paper**.
2. The paper is dipped into a **solvent** (e.g., water).
3. The solvent travels up the paper by **capillary action**.
4. Substances in the mixture **separate** because they travel at **different speeds**.
5. The pattern of spots produced is the **chromatogram**.

---

# 🎯 **Why Do Substances Separate?**

Each substance has different:

* **Solubility** (how well it dissolves in the solvent)
* **Attraction to the paper**

A highly soluble substance moves **further** up the paper.
A less soluble substance moves **a shorter distance**.

# 🧪 **Features of a Chromatogram**

| Feature           | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Baseline**      | Pencil line where the sample is placed (above solvent) |
| **Solvent front** | How far the solvent travelled                          |
| **Spots**         | Each spot represents a different substance             |
| **Rf value**      | Number used to identify substances                     |

# 🔢 **Rf Values — Identifying Substances**

The **Rf value** helps compare chromatograms and identify substances.

### Formula:

[
\text{Rf} = \frac{\text{Distance moved by substance}}{\text{Distance moved by solvent}}
]

### Example:

* Substance moved: **4 cm**
* Solvent front: **8 cm**

[
Rf = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5
]

Each substance has a **known Rf value** in a given solvent, so scientists compare their results to data tables.

# 🔍 **How to Analyse a Chromatogram**

### **1. Count the number of spots**

Each spot = one substance.
Example: 3 spots → mixture has **3 substances**.

### **2. Compare spot positions**

If two samples have spots:

* at the **same height**
* and **same colour**
  then they **contain the same substance**.

### **3. Calculate and compare Rf values**

If Rf values match known data → the substance is identified.

### **4. Check if the mixture is pure or impure**

* **Pure substance** → ONE spot
* **Mixture** → TWO or MORE spots

# 🖼️ **Example Chromatogram (ASCII)**

```
Solvent front
------------------------------------
          ● A2          ● B2
   ● A1                 ● B1
------------------------------------
      Sample A        Sample B
       (mixture)       (mixture)
Baseline
```

Analysis:

* Both A and B have **two spots** → both are mixtures.
* A1 and B1 are at the **same height** → they contain the same substance.
* A2 and B2 do **not** match → different second substances.

---

# 🧠 **Common Questions Students Ask**

### 🔹 *Does a bigger spot mean more substance?*

Yes — larger/darker spots usually mean more of that substance is present.

### 🔹 *Can two different substances have the same colour?*

Yes — that’s why **Rf values** are used as confirmation.

### 🔹 *Do Rf values change?*

Rf values depend on the **solvent** used.
Different solvent → different Rf value.

# 📝 **Summary for Students**

* Chromatography separates mixtures into pure substances.
* Chromatograms show how far each substance travelled.
* Substances that travel the same distance are likely the same.
* **Rf values** help identify substances accurately.
* Pure = 1 spot, Mixture = multiple spots.
