# Year 8 Biology – Cells & Microscopy (Oxford style, explained at KS3 depth)

Below are clear, test-ready answers to each checklist question. I’ve kept the science accurate but friendly for a Year 8 learner.

## 2.1.1 a — Using light microscopes to observe cells in eukaryotes

**Eukaryotic organisms** (plants, animals, fungi, protists) have cells with a **nucleus** and **membrane-bound organelles**.
With a **light microscope**, you can:

* **See** overall **cell shape** and **basic structures**: cell wall (plants), cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, chloroplasts (if present), and large vacuoles.
* **Compare different cells**:

  * **Onion epidermis** (plant): brick-like cells with a **cell wall**; nucleus usually visible after staining; **no chloroplasts** in onion skin.
  * **Elodea/pondweed leaf** (plant): many **chloroplasts** moving (cytoplasmic streaming).
  * **Cheek cells** (animal): thin, irregular outline; **no cell wall**; central **nucleus** after staining.
  * **Yeast** (fungus): small oval cells, sometimes budding.

**Method (fast overview):**

1. Put a thin specimen on a slide with a drop of water.
2. Add a cover slip (lower at an angle to avoid bubbles).
3. Start focusing on **low power** (4× objective), then move to **medium/high** power.
4. Adjust **coarse** focus first, then **fine** focus and **light/diaphragm**.

**What to record:** labelled drawings, magnification used, scale bar (if given), and brief observations (e.g., “chloroplasts present”).

## 2.1.1 b — Preparing and examining microscope slides (light microscopy)

**Key steps to make a good slide (wet mount):**

1. **Clean slide** and **cover slip**.
2. **Place specimen**: a very **thin** layer (use forceps/needle).
3. **Add a drop of water** (or stain).
4. **Lower cover slip** gently with a mounted needle to reduce air bubbles.
5. **Blot excess liquid** with tissue.

**Safety & care:** carry microscope by **arm + base**, keep lenses clean, never use **coarse focus** on high power (to avoid crashing the lens into the slide).

**Examination:**

* Start on **lowest magnification**.
* Centre the specimen, then switch to higher magnifications.
* Adjust **diaphragm** for contrast.

---

## 2.1.1 c — Using stains in light microscopy

**Why stain?** Many cell parts are **transparent**. Stains increase **contrast** so structures show up.

**Common stains (KS3 friendly):**

* **Iodine solution**: stains starch and makes plant cell features (like the **nucleus**) darker; good for onion cells.
* **Methylene blue**: stains **nuclei** in animal cells (great for cheek cells).
* **Safranin**: red counterstain; helps show **cell walls**.

**How to apply:** put a drop on the specimen **before** the cover slip, or add at the edge of the cover slip and draw it through with tissue on the opposite side (**capillary action**).

## 2.1.1 d — Drawing and annotating cells

**Rules for good biological drawings:**

* Use a **sharp pencil**; **no shading**, just clean lines.
* Draw what you see, **not** what you expect.
* **Title** + **magnification** (e.g., “Onion epidermis at ×100”).
* **Scale**: if given a scale bar, use it.
* **Labels** with straight lines: cell wall, cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, chloroplasts (plants), vacuole.

**Tip:** Keep proportions realistic—e.g., plant cells usually look regular and boxy; animal cells often look irregular.

---

## 2.1.1 e — Using the magnification formula

**Formula:**
[
\textbf{Magnification} = \frac{\text{Image size}}{\text{Actual size}}
]

* Rearranged:

  * **Actual size** = Image size ÷ Magnification
  * **Image size** = Actual size × Magnification

**Total microscope magnification = eyepiece × objective**
(e.g., 10× eyepiece and 40× objective ⇒ **400×** total)

**Worked example:**
A drawing of a cheek cell is 50 mm wide. Microscope magnification was 100×.
Actual size = 50 mm ÷ 100 = **0.5 mm** = **500 µm**.

**Units tip:** 1 mm = 1000 µm (micrometres).

---

## 2.1.1 f — Magnification vs Resolution (know the difference!)

* **Magnification**: how much **bigger** an image appears.
* **Resolution**: how **clear** the image is—how close two points can be and still be seen as **separate**.

  * A picture can be **highly magnified but blurry** if resolution is poor.
  * Light microscopes have **lower resolution** than electron microscopes.

---

## 2.1.1 g — Ultrastructure of eukaryotic cells & organelle functions

(Electron microscopes show these in more detail; you only need the **key jobs**.)

* **Nucleus** – contains **DNA**; controls the cell.
* **Cell membrane** – **selectively permeable** barrier; controls entry/exit.
* **Cytoplasm** – jelly-like medium for **chemical reactions**.
* **Mitochondria** – **respiration**; release energy (ATP).
* **Ribosomes** – **protein synthesis** (make proteins).
* **Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**

  * **Rough ER (RER)** – has ribosomes; **folds/exports proteins**.
  * **Smooth ER (SER)** – makes **lipids** and helps detoxify.
* **Golgi apparatus** – **modifies, sorts, packages** proteins into vesicles.
* **Lysosomes** – contain **enzymes** to digest old cell parts or microbes (mostly animal cells).
* **Cytoskeleton** – protein fibres that give **shape** and help **movement** inside cells.
* **Plant-only big ones:**

  * **Cell wall (cellulose)** – **support & protection**.
  * **Chloroplasts** – **photosynthesis** (contain chlorophyll).
  * **Large central vacuole** – **sap storage**, turgor (keeps cells firm).

## 2.1.1 h — Analysing photomicrographs of eukaryotic cell components

When you’re given a microscope photo:

1. **Identify structures** by shape/location:

   * **Nucleus**: dark, round/oval, often central (animal) or to the side (plant with big vacuole).
   * **Chloroplasts**: green (in colour images), oval discs in leaf cells.
   * **Cell wall**: thick, clear border around plant cells.
   * **Mitochondria** (electron micrographs): bean-shaped with inner folds (cristae).
2. **Use the scale bar** to estimate sizes (apply the magnification formula).
3. **State evidence**: e.g., “Presence of chloroplasts shows this is a plant leaf cell.”
4. **Compare**: animal vs plant, or different tissues (root vs leaf).

## 2.1.1 i — How organelles work together to make & secrete proteins

**Protein production & secretion pathway:**

1. **DNA in nucleus** provides instructions.
2. **Ribosomes** (often on **Rough ER**) make the **polypeptide** (protein chain).
3. Protein enters the **Rough ER**, is **folded/processed**.
4. **Transport vesicles** carry proteins to the **Golgi apparatus**.
5. **Golgi** **modifies** (e.g., adds sugars), **sorts**, and **packages** proteins.
6. **Secretory vesicles** move to the **cell membrane**.
7. **Exocytosis**: vesicle fuses with the membrane and **releases** the protein outside the cell.

**Energy** for these steps is supplied by **mitochondria (ATP)**.

---

## 2.1.1 j — Why the cytoskeleton matters

The **cytoskeleton** is a network of protein fibres inside the cell.

* **Gives shape & support** (like internal scaffolding).
* **Anchors organelles** and keeps them organised.
* **Tracks for movement** of vesicles (helps secretion).
* **Cell division**: forms the **spindle** that separates chromosomes.
* **Cell movement**: helps **cilia/flagella** move and enables **muscle contraction** (with actin and myosin).

## 2.1.1 k — Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic cells (similarities & differences)

**Similarities:**

* Both have a **cell membrane**, **cytoplasm**, **DNA**, and **ribosomes**.

**Differences:**

| Feature      | **Prokaryotic** (e.g., bacteria)          | **Eukaryotic** (plants/animals/fungi/protists)                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nucleus      | **No nucleus** (DNA free in **nucleoid**) | **True nucleus** with nuclear envelope                            |
| Size         | **Smaller** (~1–5 µm)                     | **Larger** (~10–100 µm)                                           |
| Organelles   | **No membrane-bound** organelles          | **Many** (mitochondria, ER, Golgi, etc.)                          |
| Cell wall    | **Yes** (peptidoglycan, in most)          | **Plants/fungi** have walls (cellulose/chitin); **animals** don’t |
| DNA form     | **Circular** DNA; may have **plasmids**   | **Linear** chromosomes                                            |
| Ribosomes    | **Smaller** (70S)                         | **Larger** (80S)                                                  |
| Reproduction | Mainly **binary fission**                 | **Mitosis/meiosis**                                               |

**Quick remember:** Pro = **Primitive & Plain** (no nucleus); Eu = **‘You’** (complex, nucleus).

## Speed-revise checklist (1–2 mins)

* Use **iodine** for plant, **methylene blue** for animal nuclei.
* **Magnification = image ÷ actual** (watch your **units**!).
* **Magnification ≠ resolution**; resolution = clarity.
* **Nucleus–RER–Golgi–vesicle–exocytosis** = protein secretion route.
* **Plants**: cell wall, chloroplasts, big vacuole. **Animals**: none of those.
* **Prokaryotes**: small, no nucleus, circular DNA.

## Tiny practice Q (with answer)

**Q:** You draw a chloroplast as 20 mm long at ×1000. What is its actual length in µm?
**A:** Actual = 20 mm ÷ 1000 = 0.02 mm = **20 µm**.

If you want, I can turn this into a **one-page revision sheet** or a **self-quiz** with answers.
